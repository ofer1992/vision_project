8.10:
  Where are we standing:
    Can track boards fairly well without vertical switch, and without being
    ooi for too long.
    Not much work on extracting slides out of rectified video yet. Considering
    giving up on that part.

  My attempts at tracking:
  - FP tracking, choosing median as motion for all corners, and template
    tracking on top for added accuracy. Susceptible to bad tracking and
    doesn't perform well with ooi boards.
  - Similar except instead of median as motion, find homography. Should be
    better but sometimes I get bad homographies and lose corners.
  - Orb feature matching and homography finding every ~second. Less resources
    needed, but also has ad matches every once in a while.

  Issues to be considered:
  - feature points on the professor. distrupts tracking. tried using ped
    detector with reasonable results, but hasn't improved tracking much and
    expensive.
  - template tracking doesn't work well when corner is occluded. also, when
    there is a vertical board switch doesn't manage to track the board up yet
    doesn't recognize new board as same corner.
  - can't handle vertical board switch

  Next steps:
  - decide whether old tracker is good enough or should be discarded and focus
    on improving homography based tracker.
  - build basic infrastructure for debugging bad homographies?
  - template tracking as indication of occlusion?
  - decide what to do with vertical board switch
  - review "multiple view geometry", specifically homographies and consequences
    of rotation.
